df = pd.read_json('yelp_academic_dataset_business.json', lines=True)

# Convert the 'categories' column from a comma-separated string to a list
df['categories'] = df['categories'].apply(lambda x: x.split(', ') if pd.notnull(x) else [])

# Display the updated DataFrame
print(df.head())

# Save the updated DataFrame to a new JSON file
